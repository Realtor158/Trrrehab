    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>Our mission at TRR Rehab is to provide compassionate, high-quality therapy services tailored to each individual. We believe in a client-centered approach where every treatment plan is customized based on a thorough assessment of the client’s strengths, challenges, and goals. We aim to empower children and adults to live fuller, healthier, and more independent lives.</p>

    <h3>Occupational Therapy for Autistic Children</h3>
    <p>At TRR Rehab, we understand the unique challenges that children with autism face. Our occupational therapy services are designed to help children improve their daily living skills, sensory processing, and social interactions. Whether a child needs assistance with fine motor skills, sensory integration, or enhancing their social communication, our therapists use evidence-based practices to support growth and development.</p>

    <h4>Key Focus Areas:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory Integration Therapy:</strong> We help children process sensory information more effectively, reducing sensitivity or under-responsiveness to sights, sounds, touch, and other stimuli.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Care Skills:</strong> We work on improving activities like dressing, eating, and grooming, helping children gain independence.</li>
        <li><strong>Social and Play Skills:</strong> Our therapists support children in learning to play, interact with peers, and engage in social environments with greater confidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine and Gross Motor Skills:</strong> From improving handwriting to increasing strength and coordination, we help children develop motor skills that enhance their ability to perform daily tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our team takes a compassionate approach, working closely with families to ensure that therapy is not only effective but also enjoyable for the child. We provide detailed evaluations, ongoing progress reports, and support for parents so that each child’s therapy journey is both smooth and productive.</p>

    <h3>Physiotherapy for Adults and Older Adults</h3>
    <p>Our physiotherapy services cater to adults and older adults who are dealing with a range of physical conditions, including injury recovery, chronic pain, age-related mobility issues, and neurological disorders. At TRR Rehab, we focus on <strong>improving mobility, reducing pain, and promoting overall physical health</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Common Conditions Treated:</h4>

        <li><strong>Arthritis and Joint Pain:</strong> We help alleviate pain and stiffness in the joints, improving range of motion and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Surgical Rehabilitation:</strong> Our therapists work with clients after surgery to ensure a safe and efficient recovery, focusing on regaining strength, flexibility, and coordination.</li>
        <li><strong>Neurological Disorders:</strong> We provide therapy for conditions such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis, with the goal of enhancing mobility and function.</li>
        <li><strong>Chronic Pain Management:</strong> Through a combination of exercises, manual therapy, and education, we help clients manage chronic pain and regain independence in their daily activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance and Fall Prevention:</strong> For older adults, we offer specialized programs to improve balance, prevent falls, and maintain safety in everyday movements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our physiotherapists are dedicated to helping clients achieve the highest level of physical function possible. We use a range of therapeutic techniques, including exercise, manual therapy, and patient education, to address each client's specific needs.</p>
